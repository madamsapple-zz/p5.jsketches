Designed an interactive poster using WEBGL (3-d graphics), which tried to provide critical research on a native food item in accessible ways.

Please open the entire folder in a p5.js sketch online. Press 'i' (the issue), 'r' (research question), and 'h' (hypothesis) to navigate through the poster's visual commentary. 

Here is the miro link for the entire research process behind the food item I chose -  Roohafza: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOYMlHmw=/
